RotP - Tactical Council Votes

Mini mod for RotP, changing the behaviour of the base AI concerning council votes. 
AIs will base their decision for an nominee on their relations and the difference in power, according to the AI personalities and based on a fixed score, 
random elements in the decision are removed (except for the erratic Bot type - the gravitas of diplomacy and strength will change from vote to vote for them).

Based on RotP 1.02a
